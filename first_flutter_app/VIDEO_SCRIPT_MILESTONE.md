## 📹 Video Structure & Talking Points

### INTRO SECTION (0:00 - 0:15)
**What to Show on Screen:**
- Running Flutter app (Chrome or emulator)
- VS Code terminal visible

**What to Say:**
> "In this demo, I’ll show how Hot Reload, the Debug Console, and Flutter DevTools improve Flutter development productivity. I’ll make a live UI change, log output in the console, and inspect the widget tree with DevTools."

---

### SECTION 1: Hot Reload (0:15 - 0:40)
**What to Show on Screen:**
- Open a widget file (e.g., main.dart or stateless_stateful_demo.dart)
- Change a text label or color
- Save file
- Press `r` in terminal to hot reload

**What to Say:**
> "Hot Reload lets me apply code changes instantly without restarting the app or losing state. I’m changing this text and saving the file. Now I press ‘r’ in the terminal, and the change appears immediately. This makes UI iteration super fast."

**Key Points:**
- Instant UI updates
- State preserved
- Faster iteration

---

### SECTION 2: Debug Console (0:40 - 1:05)
**What to Show on Screen:**
- Add a debugPrint() inside a button handler
- Press the button in the app
- Show log output in Debug Console

**What to Say:**
> "Now I’ll demonstrate the Debug Console. I added a debugPrint statement inside a button handler. When I press the button, the console logs the updated state. This helps me trace behavior, check values, and catch errors quickly."

**Key Points:**
- Real-time logs
- Useful for debugging
- Works with print/debugPrint

---

### SECTION 3: Flutter DevTools (1:05 - 1:40)
**What to Show on Screen:**
- Open DevTools (VS Code command palette → Open DevTools)
- Show Widget Inspector
- Highlight widget tree
- Optional: open Performance tab

**What to Say:**
> "Next is Flutter DevTools. I opened it and used the Widget Inspector to view the widget tree. This helps me understand layout structure and troubleshoot UI issues. The Performance tab shows frame rendering times, which helps spot performance problems."

**Key Points:**
- Widget Inspector for layout debugging
- Performance tab for frame analysis
- Memory & Network tabs for deeper insights

---

### WRAP-UP (1:40 - 2:00)
**What to Show on Screen:**
- App running + DevTools window

**What to Say:**
> "Hot Reload speeds up UI changes, the Debug Console gives real-time insights, and DevTools helps inspect and optimize the app. Together, these tools make Flutter development faster, smarter, and more efficient."
