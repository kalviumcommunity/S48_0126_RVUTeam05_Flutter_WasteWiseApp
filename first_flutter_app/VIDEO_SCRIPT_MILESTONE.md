## 📹 Video Structure & Talking Points

### INTRO SECTION (0:00 - 0:15)
**What to Show on Screen:**
- Running Flutter app (any screen showing the theme applied)
- VS Code showing ThemeData configuration in main.dart

**What to Say:**
> "In this demo, I'll show how I applied consistent styles, colors, and text themes across the app. Using Flutter’s ThemeData keeps the UI cohesive and easy to maintain."

### SECTION 1: Theme Setup (0:15 - 0:40)
**What to Show on Screen:**
- main.dart with ThemeData (color scheme, text themes)
- Highlight primary color and text theme definitions

**What to Say:**
> "First, I configured ThemeData in main.dart. I set a primary color scheme and defined text styles for headings, body text, and buttons. This ensures typography and colors stay consistent across all screens."

**Key Points:**
- ThemeData centralizes UI styling
- Primary color defines app identity
- TextTheme standardizes typography

### SECTION 2: Consistent Colors (0:40 - 1:05)
**What to Show on Screen:**
- App UI demonstrating consistent button colors and backgrounds
- Highlight AppBar color and card colors

**What to Say:**
> "Notice how the AppBar, buttons, and cards use the same color palette. By referencing the theme instead of hardcoding colors, the design stays unified and easy to update."

**Key Points:**
- Use theme colors instead of hardcoded values
- Consistent palette improves UX
- Easier global updates

### SECTION 3: Text Themes in Widgets (1:05 - 1:35)
**What to Show on Screen:**
- UI showing headings, subtitles, and body text
- Code snippet using Theme.of(context).textTheme

**What to Say:**
> "Here I apply text styles using Theme.of(context).textTheme. Headings, subtitles, and body text follow the same typographic system, making the UI clean and professional."

**Key Points:**
- TextTheme enforces consistency
- No repeated TextStyle declarations
- Cleaner, maintainable widgets

### WRAP-UP (1:35 - 2:00)
